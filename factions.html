            <p>
                The Witch-realm of Angmar was in ancient years, a stronghold of evil in the north, a power that for centuries made war with Arnor under their fell Witch-king, the Lord of the Nazgûl. Of old the faction was home to many Orcs, Trolls, Wargs, and Men, and by its power the North Kingdom of the Dúnedain was wiped out. But Angmar too fell shortly after, for the High Elves and Men of Gondor destroyed their armies in a battle at Fornost, and the vale of Angmar was purged of evil.             </p>

                Bree-land is a small settlement of Men and Hobbits to the east of the shire. Protected by the watchful eyes of the Dúnedain of the North very few orcs or wargs ravage these lands. Major towns are Bree, Archet, Staddle, and Combe.            </p>

They reside between the Celduin and Carnen Rivers, with their capital in the city of Dale, located between the Lonely Mountain and Esgaroth, a prosperous city through trade-gained cooperation among Erebor, Dorwinion and the Woodland Realm.             </p>

            <p>
                Dol Guldur is an evil-infested region at the southwest corner of Mirkwood where Sauron lived before moving to Mordor. The forces of Dol Guldur represent the source of all corruption in the forests of Mirkwood, and their sinister urge to conquer directly contrasts the tranquil seclusion of their counterpart faction: the Wood-elves.             </p>

                Dunland is the home of the sworn enemies of Rohan, the Dunlendings. After they were driven out of their old home in Rohan and Enedwaith, they went to Dunland to scrape a living off rocks, making them wild and vengeful.             </p>

            <p>
                Durin's Folk, the Longbeards, Dwarves of the Iron Hills and Erebor, are master craftsmen and miners. They value the riches of the earth, and delve deeply through complex systems of mines in the mountainous terrain of their home. Once fallen from greatness, the Sigin-tarâg of Khazad-dûm have since regained their former glory, and the Kingdom of Erebor, home of Dain under the Mountain, is the zenith of the Khazâd in the last days of the Third Age.             </p>

                The Blue Mountains are the peaceful home to the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains, cousins to the Dwarves of the Iron Hills. Like all their kin, Blue Dwarves have a love for the precious metals of the earth, and a large part of their time is spent in mines deep underground.             </p>

            <p>
                Gondor is the greatest kingdom of Men in Middle-earth, bordered by Rohan to the north, Harad to the south, the cape of Andrast and the Sea to the west, and Mordor to the east. Its first capital was Osgiliath, but was moved to Minas Tirith in TA 1640 and has remained there since. Other major fortresses include Dol Amroth in Belfalas and Pelargir, which is a city on the Anduin.             </p>

            <p>
                The Gulf of Harad is a coastal region home to the Haradric people known as the Gulfings. This land is shaped and nourished by the Gulf of Harad, named by its inhabitants as Khopazûl, which borders the region to the south and east. The region covers the area south-east of the Great Desert and north-east of the Far Harad Grasslands. This part of Near Harad is still relatively dry, but fertile and home to a flourishing sub-faction of Near Haradrim who are known as the Gulfings.

            <p>
                The Half-trolls of Perdorogwaith are monsters, created by Sauron long ago. These brutish warriors are savage and unintelligent, but nonetheless are a force to be reckoned with. Their warriors are strong and without fear. Their Rhino cavalry can cut through great armies. And worst of all, all Half-trolls have a lust for blood that does not stop until they are destroyed. Recently, they have entered once more into an alliance with Mordor, and the Southrons as well, and have made peace with the Morwaith. Many soon will fight to destroy the realm of Gondor, but for now they have enemies closer at hand: the Taurethrim of the jungles and the Cerinrim of the bushlands.

            <p>
                Hobbits are small, Man-like, and jolly in nature. They are not well-known, but they are often called "The Little Folk", or "Halflings", by those that know (or have heard) of them. They enjoy their meals very much, and have them very often. They are not warlike, but instead love the comforts of their homes. The most common forms are dug into hills, and called "Hobbit holes", or "Smials", but they have also been known to live in houses above ground, too.

            <p>
                Isengard is located deep in Nan Curunír in the Misty Mountains. It is the stronghold of the Wizard Saruman the Wise, of Many Colours, from which he makes war upon the Free Peoples. But he is not in truth allied to Sauron, and seeks to supplant him and seize Middle-earth for himself. For that he needs the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, to give him power unimaginable.

            <p>
                Lindon is a coastal biome where the Elves of Lindon spawn. It is a fair land of green, rolling hills and costal plains. Lindon, along with Rivendell and Lórien, is one of the few realms that Sauron never touched. Lindon is west of the Blue Mountains and east of the Great Sea Belegaer. During the First Age, it was called Ossiriand by the Sindar, and the Laiquendi, along with Beren and Lúthien, lived here. Now, it is the only remnant of the ancient land of Beleriand.

                The Galadhrim of Lothlórien are a small yet powerful Elvish faction. Their land is one of beauty and light, headed by the Elven Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel. Lórien is well-defended by slender elven-bows, but a hidden power is there as well. In it alone grow the great golden Mellyrn.

            <h4 class="headlinearticles"> Mordor </h4>
            <p>
                Mordor is the fearsome realm of the Dark Lord Sauron, utterly subservient to his will. The greatest of the forces of the Shadow, the Mordor faction is the strongest power in Middle-earth, with plans to crush the Free Peoples and dominate the world. Based in the land of Mordor, this faction is composed of millions of foul creatures, most notably the Mordor Orcs, who serve their Dark Lord alongside a number of other fell beings. The faction of Mordor is indisputably evil and formidable, a black tide that threatens to sweep the Free Peoples of Middle-earth into the Sea. The power of Sauron grows by the day, and soon all of Middle-earth will fall sway to him and his servants!

            <p>
                Though their crafts and way of life may seem primitive to the Men of the North, the Morwaith lead complex lives. Their chieftains are many, separated by great distance and divided by cultural differences. They have many strange rituals and traditions, including the ritual slaying of wild animals. They are strong warriors in battle, sometimes riding on zebras against their enemies, and wielding spears, clubs, axes, and daggers.

                The Golden Easterlings are a great kingdom of Men, bound to the will of their god, the Dark Lord, and who are ready to serve him in his war against the Free Peoples. They are the grandest of all the kingdoms in the east, and they are skilled in the art of fire. They are also in a trade partnership with their neighbours, the Dorwidhrim. They also are known for their golden armour, hence the name, "Golden Easterlings".

            <p>
                Rivendell, or Imladris, was an Elven refuge in the Misty Mountains on the eastern edge of Eriador. It was called "The Last Homely House East of the Sea", due to the remnant of Elvendom and ancient power that dwelt there, of a kind not found elsewhere east of Valinor.

                Rohan is the realm of the Rohirrim, whose lifestyles revolve around the training and breeding of horses which they hold sacred. Because of this, the Rohan faction is comprised of the best horses and cavalry in all of Middle-Earth.

            <p>
                The Southron Coasts is the region of Near Harad which is home to the Southrons and their warrior-folk. This land surrounds the river Astrasir that springs in the nearby Harad Mountains and flows north towards Umbar. The region covers the area south, east and north of Umbar along the western borders of the Great Desert of Harad. This part of Near Harad gets sufficient rainfall and is relatively lush despite its sandy soils.

                Once a mighty empire that held all of Far Harad under its sway, the Taurethrim are but a shadow of their former selves. They dwell in the Far Harad Jungle, defending their homes from their sworn enemies, the Morwaith. In battle they wield deadly obsidian blades, and their hunters carry blowguns and poisoned darts.

            <p>
                The Wood-elves (Silvan Elves or Tawarwaith) of the Woodland Realm are the most isolated of the Elven race, being both powerful warriors and distrustful characters at the same time. In fact, they will not hesitate to attack anyone that does not have at least +50 alignment with their faction. However, they attack less frequently, as your alignment approaches +50.
