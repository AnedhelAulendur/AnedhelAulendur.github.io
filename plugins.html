                    The DeathPlugin is a plugin made by Jukoz. This plugin create a corpse on a player's death by placing a skull on a fence, that can be interacted/open upon a rightClick<br>
                    Players can so die & lose their loots and hunts people to obtain their loot, by respecting hunt rules of course.<br>
                    Also, once the skull is empty of loot, it container is destroyed and become a simply vanilla skull<br> <br>
                    *DeathPlugin is working on a HashMap system, it's currently work in progress to save dead people's loot in a case of a server crash, since this event will destroy the hashmap and so the loots of every corpses.

                    The plugin is made by Axel_HiddenIsMe_Rooftop (not us)<br>
                    Therefore, we took materials id's of of Lord of the Ring mod, and included it in the plugin's config.yml file, so now we can use modded stairs blocks as chairs! <br><br>
                    *This plugin teleports the player, so /back will result in your last seat location.
