                    Region => When talking about regions, we always refer to the claim regions shown in #claim-regions.<br>

                    1. No Griefing or stealing of any build if it is clearly bannered. Unbannered builds are fair game for STEALING only. <br>
                    <br>
                    2. No hacks or cheating clients including xray, unfair PvP advantage mods, or AFK macros. <br>
                    <br>
                    3. No insulting or thoughtfully hurting someone. Treat others how you want to be treated. <br>
                    <br>
                    4. Staff has the final word. If they ask you to stop doing something harmful and you continue it, they will mute or ban you depending on the severity and frequency. <br>
                    <br>
                    5. Middle Earth is the only allowed dimension. Overworld, Nether, End and Utumno are forbidden. <br>
                    <br>
                    6. No Alts of any kind on Discord or in game. <br>
                    <br>
                    7. Please keep public conversations safe for work. Excessive swearing or NSFW conversations will result in a mute. <br>
                    <br>
                    8. No slurs of ANY kind. <br>
                    <br>
                    9. DO NOT consistently bother staff. We are usually busy and don't get paid to do this. We will get to apps and questions as fast as we can.

                <p>
                    1. PvP in someone's base/build is only allowed during wars or by mutual agreement. <br>
                    <br>
                    2. Unclaimed regions are open for PvP. <br>
                    <br>
                    3. Unbannered builds are open to PvP and looting. The build owner is responsible for protecting his build. <br>
                    <br>
                    4. PvP during events is only allowed if the event staff gives consent. <br> 
                    <br>
                    5. All mounts except Rhinos are usable in combat if your alignment allows it. Rhino's can only be used by Half-Trolls. <br>
                    <br>
                    6. New players deserve a chance to get started! Do not attack them on the first day without their consent! <br>
                    <br>
                    7. If mutual PvP is agreed upon, please return all items taken from the death chest unless otherwise told by the owner of the items. <br>
                    <br>
                    8. Do not use PvP death glitching to get into builds. This is griefing. <br>
                    <br>
                    9. If you die outside of a bannered build and someone loots your items outside of mutually agreed combat, that is allowed and the thief has no obligation to return the items as they are in an unbannered area.

                <h4 class="headlinearticles"> Gear Rules </h4>
                <p>
                    1. Mithril armour and weapons are not allowed under any circumstances in PvP! <br>
                    <br>
                    2. In PvE a player may use any weapon, armour, unit, or mount. <br>
                    <br>
                    3. Gear of your faction is to be used in PvP, Hunts, and any other kind of Roleplay and war combat. <br>
                    <br>
                    4. During events, or a hunt, faction gear is the default gear, other gear may only be used if staff allows it. <br>
                    <br>
                    5. Default Faction gear means the armour and weapons your faction provides in the mod and any weapons acquired by a trade. Default faction gear has no modifiers and can not be maxed by the player. The gear must be returned to the Mod or Admin after it has been used. <br>
                    <br>
                    6. A faction can acquire access to other factions weapons (weapons only not the armour) by a mutually agreed trade with another faction. Trade may only be initiated by a faction leader and must follow the trade rules found in the war guide. This weapon will be added to your "default" faction gear as long as the trade goes on. <br> 
                    <br>
                    7. If you use a roleplay character you may use the gear you described in your application, even if it is not the faction provided gear (staff has to approve the gear in the application and reserves the right to deny gear that does not fit the provided character application.) <br>
                    <br>
                    8. A player can acquire gear from other factions through roleplay, that has been accepted by staff. A player CANNOT acquire gear through low effort roleplay such as: killing things, stealing gear, buying gear, smithing it themselves (without proper roleplay.) <br>
                    <br>
                    9. Item names should be PG, we will ask you to rename them if they are not. If this rule is not followed after being asked, we will take and delete your item.

                <p>
                    1. The Hunter has to use  /hunt playername. <br>
                    <br>
                    2. The Hunter and the Hunted must be within 7000 blocks of each other for the hunt to start. <br>
                    <br>
                    3. Only faction or RP character gear may be used by the hunters during hunts. <br>
                    <br>
                    4. The hunt begins after 2 minutes. No PvP is allowed during this time. Once the 2 minutes ends, no one may join anymore. <br>
                    <br>
                    5. The hunt ends after 10 minutes, unless all the hunters or all the hunted die. <br>
                    <br>
                    6. During a hunt no one partaking are allowed to teleport or fast-travel. <br>
                    <br>
                    7. Everyone who participates by aiding either the hunter or hunted must use /aid playername. <br>
                    <br>
                    8. If someone dies, they may no longer partake in the hunt. <br>
                    <br>
                    9. Teleporting or partaking after the declaration or without informing whether you hunt or aid the hunted during the 2 minutes prep time will ensure in losing your entire inventory and a warning. <br>
                    <br>
                    10. No units can be used in hunts. <br>
                    <br>
                    11. After the hunt is over, the hunted can not be hunted again for 30 minutes unless they declare a hunt themselves. <br>
                    <br>
                    12. You can not pass your inventory to a friend in order to avoid potentially losing stuff after a hunt has been declared. Nor can you hide it before hand once the hunt has been declared. <br>

                <p>
                    1. No sellswords if you want to help another faction, then RP to that faction.<br>
                    2. To revive a dead faction, build a town in unclaimed region.<br>
                    3. Adventure mode forced on for war partakers.<br>
                    4. Faction leaders can give lordship of regions to players where they will not need approval on political matters from faction leader (such as moving units, claimbuilds, productions sites, etc.).<br>
                    5. When a build is attacked, both the attacker and defender need to find a mutually agreed upon day and time to do the fight. Please discuss a secondary date incase the first does not work! If the first and second are cancelled due to whatever situation, then a final date can be discussed. If that does not work, the attacker wins that battle.

                <p>
                    1. No second chances (you lose the first battle after declaring war, you lose the war).<br>
                    2. War camps required to siege towns/keeps/capitals NOT required for villages/hamlets. <br>
                    3. Army movement channel will be created with dyno commands.<br>
                    4. Staff can revoke a war in certain situations.<br>
                    5. After a battle, staff will count remaining units and these will remain for next wars (if you lost 1 uruk hai in a battle, you can only use 4 others) unless you move your army to on of your claimbuilds which has a Watch-Tower, or in allies claimbuilds if they have it too and an embassy of your faction.

                <h4 class="headlinearticles" style="font-size: 25px;"><em>Army Movement</em></h4>
                <p>
                    1. Armies have to move region to region.<br>
                    2. Armies move 1 region every day.<br>
                    3. Armies cannot attack through an enemy region. Have to walk around, ask permission to travel or attack region blocking.<br>
                    4. 1 army per player, 2 if there is a faction's stronghold nearby(1 region) which will add 1 army slot to a Player. Only players can move the assigned army. Faction leaders can give army control players.<br>
                    5. Armies only created by claimbuilds (town/keep or above. Not from villages/towers/hamlets).<br>
                    6. RP character is with assigned army. If army is not at a battle location, player can fight but only with default faction gear as a "fill in captain".<br>
                    7. Trade company assigned to player.<br>
                    8. RP character can be with both army and Trading Company.<br>
                    9. 5 stacks of cooked/prepared food per region moved. (eg. moving 2 tiles, you need 10 stacks of food to move that area.)<br>
                    10. Unassigned armies can be moved by faction leader between CBs in current, neighbouring regions.<br>
                </p>
                <h4 class="headlinearticles" style="font-size: 25px;"><em>Army Creation</em></h4>
                <p>
                    1. Armies are created when a town/keep is created (or above). They need appropriate buildings in order to have specific units (orc pits for orcs, barracks for human soldiers, archery ranges for archers, troll cages for trolls, etc.)<br>
                    2. If an army is defeated- new army costs 5k, a small pouch of food, OR 3 stacks of iron.<br>
                    3. Warg bombers banned as units.<br>
                    4. Units for battles MUST be bought at the start of a battle by a provided commander.<br>
                    5. Equipment on units goes up to next tier (Gunda orc with armour goes to 1 token from .5) unless it's same equipment (ex. black uruks units with maxed black uruk's gear is ok).<br>
                    6. You may not change custom gear after army is created. You MAY change weapons<br>
                    7. If staff catch players changing gear illegally in battles, we will butcher the unit. If other units die as collateral, we won't refund those.<br>
                    8. Units must be specified upon army creation. You may not change units unless the army is defeated and you raise a new one.<br>
                    9. If you want to add armour to a unit, you MUST let us know on army creation.<br>

                    4. More claimbuilds will give a nation a stronger foothold in a region. (More builds means more places that must be captured)<br>
