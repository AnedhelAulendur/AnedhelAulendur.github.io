                <h4 class="headlinearticles" style="font-size: 25px;"><em>Army Creation</em></h4>
                <p>
                    1. Armies are created when a town/keep is created (or above). They need appropriate buildings in order to have specific units (orc pits for orcs, barracks for human soldiers, archery ranges for archers, troll cages for trolls, etc.)<br>
                    2. If an army is defeated- new army costs 5k, a small pouch of food, OR 3 stacks of iron.<br>
                    3. Warg bombers banned as units.<br>
                    4. Units for battles MUST be bought at the start of a battle by a provided commander.<br>
                    5. Equipment on units goes up to next tier (Gunda orc with armour goes to 1 token from .5) unless it's same equipment (ex. black uruks units with maxed black uruk's gear is ok).<br>
                    6. You may not change custom gear after army is created. You MAY change weapons<br>
                    7. If staff catch players changing gear illegally in battles, we will butcher the unit. If other units die as collateral, we won't refund those.<br>
                    8. Units must be specified upon army creation. You may not change units unless the army is defeated and you raise a new one.<br>
                    9. If you want to add armour to a unit, you MUST let us know on army creation.<br>
